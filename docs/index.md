# AssetHelper

Helper utilities for loading game assets.

TODO - usage/installation instructions.

Docs TODOs (not on this page):
- Guide on how to find assets you might want to load
- Production cookbook/examples (various ways to use AssetHelper to load assets in prod)
- Common gotchas (never modify a prefab before instantiating it, stuff gets loaded on quit to menu, construct loadable assets during awake, ...)
